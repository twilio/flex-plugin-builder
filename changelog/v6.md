```

Refer to [Twilio Flex Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins/cli) to be up-to-date with the latest features being built on the CLI.

Plugin Flex package now uses Twilio CLI 5.0 which has upgraded [oclif](https://github.com/oclif/oclif) package version from v1 to v2.

# Highlights

* [Twilio CLI 5.0](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-cli) and oclif v2 support.
* Removed support for Node 12.
* Security fix

# Migrating to 6.x
## Upgrade using CLI

Install the Twilio CLI and the Flex Plugins extension as described [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins/cli). Then go to the plugin directory and run:

```bash
$ twilio flex:plugins:upgrade-plugin --install
```

This script should automatically upgrade your plugin to the latest version. 

## Manual Upgrade

To manually upgrade to version 6.x, modify your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "flex-plugin pre-script-check"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "flex-plugin-scripts": "^6.0.1",
    "react": "16.5.2",
    "react-dom": "16.5.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@twilio/flex-ui": "^1"
  }
}
```

# Breaking Changes

Version 6 is dropping support for
- Twilio CLI v4 and below. Make sure to upgrade to the latest version of Twilio CLI (v5) to use Flex Plugins CLI 6.x
- Node 12. Version 6.x will **only support Node 14.x.** You would need to install and use Node 14.x (preferrably LTS version) going forward to run the Flex Plugins CLI commands. This means the plugin would also have to be compatible with Node 14.x version.


# Security Fix
An issue was identified by Twilio Security that allowed piggy-backing of additional HTTP parameters on some of the API requests. This issue is now fixed in this version.
