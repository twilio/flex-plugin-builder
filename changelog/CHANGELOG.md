## 2.0.0 (May 01, 2019)

Create Flex Plugin 2.0 upgrades to the latest [Create React App 3](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).


# Highlights

* Create React App 3.0 support
* Craco (Create React App Configuration Override)
* Drops React-App-Rewired
* Jest 24

# Migrating from 1.x to 2.x

Update your global `create-flex-plugin` by running:

```bash
npm install --global create-flex-plugin
```

To update existing plugins, edit `package.json` and modify `scripts` and `dependencies`:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "bootstrap": "flex-check-start",
        "postinstall": "npm run bootstrap",
        "prestart": "npm run bootstrap",
        "start": "craco start",
        "build": "craco build",
        "test": "craco test --env=jsdom",
        "eject": "craco eject"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "@craco/craco": "^5.0.2",
        "flex-plugin": "^2",
        "craco-config-flex-plugin": "^2"
    }
}
```

Then add a `craco.config.js` to the directory and paste the following:

```js
const config = require('craco-config-flex-plugin');

module.exports = {
     ...config,
     plugins: [
          // You can customize the configuration by defining your own plugins.
          // See https://github.com/sharegate/craco/tree/master/packages/craco#develop-a-plugin
          // for more detail
     ]
};
```

Re-run `npm install` to install/update the new dependencies.

## New Features

### Create React App 3

Please visit [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for all the new changes added to Create React App 3.x.

### Craco

We have dropped the usage of React App Rewired and instead have added support for [Create React App Configuration Override](https://github.com/sharegate/craco). 

You can now easily provide your own configuration override for all Create React App options by editing the `craco.config.js`. You can easily create [plugins](https://github.com/sharegate/craco/blob/master/packages/craco/README.md#develop-a-plugin) and add them to `craco.config.js`.
